### Date: 2022/10/04

-------------------------------

#### Description 
HAR2JMX is a utility for taking an HTTP Archive (HAR) file as input and transforming it into a Java Management Extensions (JMX) file for use in Apache JMeter. HAR2JMX also takes advantage of "transactional markers" in the recorded HAR file and automatically groups sets of requests into a transaction with JMeter. A sample HAR file is included with HAR2JMX which demonstrates the use of "transactional markers". Currently, HAR2JMX is only a command-line only utility. The tool is made available in the .NET 5.0 portable runtime for Windows (win-x64), Linux (linux-x64) and macOS (osx-x64).
